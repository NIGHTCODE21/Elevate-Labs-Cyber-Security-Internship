Cyber Security Internship – Task 2
📌 Task Title

Operating System Security Fundamentals (Linux & Windows)

📝 Task Description

This task focuses on understanding and implementing OS-level security measures.
It covers user accounts, file permissions, running services, firewall setup, and OS hardening practices to reduce vulnerabilities and improve system security.

🔐 Topics Covered
1. Users & Permissions

Understanding administrator vs normal users

File permissions in Linux (ls -l, chmod, chown)

Access control mechanisms in Windows

2. Firewall & Network Security

Enabling firewall (Linux UFW / Windows Firewall)

Configuring rules for network access

3. Running Processes & Services

Identifying active processes (ps aux / Task Manager)

Disabling unnecessary services to reduce attack surface

4. OS Hardening & Best Practices

Principle of least privilege

Removing/Disabling unused software/services

Keeping system updated

Limiting root/admin access

🧠 Key Learnings

Learned how to secure operating systems and reduce attack surfaces

Practiced managing users, permissions, and firewall settings

Gained insight into running processes and unnecessary service risks

Understood OS hardening principles and best practices

📋 Commands / Steps Executed
Linux Examples
whoami
cat /etc/passwd
ls -l
chmod 755 filename
chown user:group filename
sudo ufw enable
systemctl list-units --type=service
sudo systemctl disable telnet

Windows Examples

Check Local Users: Computer Management → Local Users and Groups

Check Firewall: Windows Security → Firewall & Network Protection → Enable Firewall

Disable unnecessary services: Services.msc → Stop / Disable

✅ OS Security Checklist
Task	Status	Notes
Check users & permissions	✅	Linux & Windows commands listed above
Enable firewall	✅	Linux UFW / Windows Firewall
Identify running services	✅	Listed example commands
Disable unnecessary services	✅	Example: telnet service
Apply least privilege	✅	Used normal user for daily tasks
🎯 Outcome

Through this task, I gained practical understanding of OS-level security and how to harden Linux and Windows systems against potential attacks. This strengthens my foundational knowledge in cybersecurity practices.
